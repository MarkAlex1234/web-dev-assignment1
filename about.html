          What special features have you done or attempted in creating the
          website?
        </p>
      </li>
      <p>
        I have created/added: <br />
        - Borders around the search status results to help readability <br />
        - Made errors return with red text so users can differentiate between
        the responses easier. <br />
        - Created custom buttons so the UI looks neat. <br />
        - Layout the page using css so forms are easier to read and use.
      </p>
      <li>
        <p style="color: red">Which part(s) did you have trouble with?</p>
      </li>
      <p>
        I personally had trouble with CSS. I don't do much frontend coding, I
        enjoy coding backend so choosing the styles, understanding how to apply
        them, and learning how to <br />
        debug why the styles were not being applied was my hardest struggle in
        this assignment.
      </p>
      <li>
        <p style="color: red">What would you like to do better next time?</p>
      </li>
      <p>
        Have a better UI, with more custom features that make the project look
        good. I struggled with CSS but now with <br />
        some experience I feel I could do better next time in that regard.
      </p>
      <li>
        <p style="color: red">
          What you have learnt along the way? Did you use any references or
          resources during this project? If so, please include the sources
        </p>
      </li>
      <p>
        I have personally learnt the most about the use of HTML and CSS from
        doing this assignment. As I stated earlier I do not have much <br />
        experience with frontend projects so this exposed me to this process and
        taught me a lot. <br />
        I used these resources: <br />
        - https://www.php.net/manual/en/ <br />
        - https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_ref_mysqli.asp <br />
        - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS <br />
